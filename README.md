# Beepo's Poke-Exhibition

## This is a personal project that i started around September 2023

 Basically it was the idea of an interactive website that uses the pokemon interface for users to interact with the website
 The motivation mainly come from creative videos that i have seen of cool powerpoint presentations utilising the pokemon theme to present their projects/works
 Thus similarly, i created a website that i will use to 'present' my projects to people, kind of like an exhibition

## Current Status

Update! the csgo area is still under construction, but I have set up a website
that presents the project in a concise manner below :

Additionally, a new area has opened up, which presents some of the poems that i have wrote. I am currently working to display the chatbox in a big chatbox, but for now 
do bear with the mini chatbox! with the incoming of big chatbox, the formatting 
of the poems (which is crucial) will be visually available!

right now only this area is available. I am currently learning German, AI and Quant Physics, but when i have free time I will be working on this website so do be patient as i have alot of ideas for this website!
