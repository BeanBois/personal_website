# pp_website

## This is a personal project that i started around September 2023

### Basically it was the idea of an interactive website that uses the pokemon interface for users to interact with the website
### The motivation mainly come from creative videos that i have seen of cool powerpoint presentations utilising the pokemon theme to present their projects/works
### Thus similarly, i created a website that i will use to 'present' my projects to people, kind of like an exhibition

## Current Status

### As of now, functionality is failry stable, those there is concern with latenecy, epsecially with the UI interactions. I am looking into this
### The project that i have presented right now is my final year project, which is a self playing CSGO AI.
### Furthermore, the current layout is still fairly simple, and i look to add more animations to make the website more captivating. Designs of 
### layout might change in the future too. I do find inspirations from exhibitons in London, but right now i am busy with interviews and as such have held this project off
### looking to pick it up by mid-end December!
