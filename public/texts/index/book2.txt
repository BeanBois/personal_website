We then formularise CSGO as a Reinforcement Learning Agent. 
Firstly we treat each round of the match as a Zero-sum Game,
meaning that either the Agent wins and the enemy loses or vice versa. This will be crucial in the later parts.
To represent states, I have utilised the Game State Integration, that allows me to fetch live match information, 
and have utilised YOLOV5 to detect enemies on screen so that the agent can detect enemies while playing the game. 
To implement actions, we encode actions as binary for our agents to 'learn' with it, 
and these actions will be decoded into respective mouse and keyboard inputs. 

The 2 images above shows the Definition of States and Action.
