Hey!

Welcome to my website!

This is part of my personal project to build some sort of interactive platform to showcase my personal projects

If one is familiar with playing the game of pokemon on a laptop this main be intuitive

But for the benefit of doubt, let me simply go through how one can navigate this website

One can move around the map with the arrow keys, and interact with UI elements

To interact with UI elements, move your avatar near them, face them, then press X, 

Generally interactions require user to only press x to continue, but one may be prompted to give a response,

as of now, i will be allowing yes/no responses, but in the future i endeavour to accept open-ended response

for potentially more interactive user experience like leaving feedbacks for the environment

For now, this is how it is right now! 

With all regards...

Hello World!
