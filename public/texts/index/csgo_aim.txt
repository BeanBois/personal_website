So firstly, the aim of my project was to create a starting point for software engineers 
who share the same interest as I am, which is to build an AI playing bot for 
Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Many works have been done prior to mine, 
but they have focused on using behavioural cloning, and have not taken the 
Reinforcement Learning approach that I have taken in this project.
