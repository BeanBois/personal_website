So the first project that I will like to present will be my final year project

My final year project was one where i chose to self-proposed, meaning I have full responsibility over it

In summer, i have been thinking about ways that I could build a Reinforcement Learning agent to play CSGO

or Counter Strike: Global Offensive, a first person player shooting game. 

Thus, a small summer project that i started on a wimp became something really important

To be honest, it was way harder than i expected, and i will be lying if I said it can play well

However, it did serve as a really good experience overall, and mistakes made showed me where i can improve

There is more to be said about the project, so do spend your time exploring the place!
