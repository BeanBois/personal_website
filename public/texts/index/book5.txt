I now attempt to give my reasons as to why the agent had failed.
Firstly, the way that I had encoded the actions severely hindered exploration for the agent.
Secondly, my visual system was too na√Øve. Due to me choosing to omit majority of the image information, 
the agent could not use the image cues to geo-locate the enemy or even orientate itself to face the enemy for a duel; 
and as such what usually happens is that the agent does not orient itself towards to enemy when it is being shot at. 
If a more sophisticated visual model is seen, I can potentially see the agent being able to shoot back at the enemy 
when it is being shot at.
Thirdly, the lack of sound cues also made geo-locating enemy difficult. By omitting sound cues, 
I have taken away the information that the agent could have used to preempt the enemy. 
Sound cues gives a sense of where another player is going and their proximity, without taking the risk of being seen.
With such information, the agent might be able to take on a more strategic approach, 
as compared to the direct approach it has taken here.
