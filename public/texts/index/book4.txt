We finally move onto results. What you have been watching a sub-clip of a 100 games played 
by the final agent and against an enemy bot with 'Hard' difficulty. 
As we can see, the agent is not very sophisticated, but on a closer look, 
it is actually exploiting some of the characteristic of the bot. 
For example, it abuses the terrible aim of the bot by constantly moving around, 
so that the agent is able to buy time for the bomb to explode. This is a really interesting behaviour, 
as I had initially thought that the bot would have just stayed at the location 
where the bomb is planted in order to ambush the enemy. 
However, all in all it is considered a failure to me, 
as there is no real strategic value in its action
