To further enhance our Reinforcement Learning agent, we have also utilised Goals, 
which is a concept from academic research with regards to a Universal Value Function Approximator. 
A goal can be thought of as an 'bonus achievement' that the agent can attempt to achieve apart from its original goal. 
The purpose of the goal is to allow the agent to learn a more general task, and thus achieve generality, 
during training by doing specific task. 
Its intuition can be thought of as a separate reference point for the agent to refer to for each interaction episode.
With a separate reference point, the agent can better objectify the quality of its action as 
it now has 2 dimension of reference, 1 being its initial task, while the other being the goal. 
We treat goal as predicates, and as such implement it as a function-pointer, and a index for referencing.
