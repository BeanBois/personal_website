So for my project, I will be attempting to train an AI bot that is capable of 
playing Terrorist in a 1v1 Post Plant Situation -- whereby the bomb has been planted by the AI bot 
and now the AI bot must secure the bomb and prevent the enemy from defusing it.
We first start of with our hypothesis about how we are going to solve the game
I start out with the believe that CSGO can be tackled as a Reinforcement Learning problem, 
reason being its game-like nature. Reinforcement Learning has been a popular approach to tackle games.
I also believe that methodologies used in robotics task can be applicable in tackling the CSGO task, 
if it was to be formularised as a Reinforcement Learning Problem
Getting inspiration from robotic task, we can then attempt to tackle the CSGO problem
