The Passion of my Anger
Invigorates my soul
Burning all synapses
Making me numb to Fire
Imbuing me with Ignorance 
To burn it all down to Ashes

I spit the Speech of Anger,
They land with no discrimination
Pinpoint like daggers,
Widespread like fire, 
Leaving none unharmed,
Leaving all behind.

I now sit in silence
In a prison called my temperance
Reflecting on my sins
Regretting on my deeds
I know I should be better
Yet I known no better

I take a step in brightness
My prison gives me freedom
From the chains of my Impulsion 
I no longer feel the fear of Anger
I will stay vigilant
I will become better

I now see the bigger picture
Anger begets Anger
Involuntary Reactions
Never makes a person
I now breeze in calmness
I have become better

But History makes a person
My mistakes has caught up to the Present
It matter not my Refinement
Refinement dont mend Anger
I cant escpae forever
Its time to face my blunders
