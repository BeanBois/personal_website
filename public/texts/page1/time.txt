The Objectivity of Time,
Cruel and Fair.
Defining moments in our lives,
Seconds giving no second.

The Subjectivity of Time,
Warped with Prejudice.
Routines passing by like Seconds,
Tensions lasting a Lifetime

The Reality of Time,
Superpositioned.
The Past with pinpoint Position
The Future with unpredictable Momentum
