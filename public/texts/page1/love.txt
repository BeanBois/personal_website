my blushing Red face,
reflecting on your Blue eyes.
awestruck in Green Park,
by Colours in dull London.

Apple of my eyes,
You are my hell and heaven.
I am your Patient,
And youâ€™ll be my medicine.

the Winds of my sails,
you set my heart on Fire.
the Grounds of my stance,
you calm me down like Ocean.

But things never last,
Time can only move forward.
With time comes changes,
It was nice while it lasted.
