Crumpled papers,
How do I unfold you?
Standing out amongst my mess
How could I miss you?
Written full of my workings,
How do i forget you?

Broken Glasses,
Im sure you are still of value.
Your razor sharp pieces,
Yet i still hold tight onto you.
All your collective pieces,
You remind me of a time we were used to.

Shattered friendship,
Oh how i have disappointed you.
My Preposterous Expectations,
I wish I hadnt put them on all you.
My Silencing Pride,
I wish I didnt turn my back on you,

A point that used to be of no return,
A point that i now constantly come to.
The honour that used to respect you,
became a pride that rejects you,
which now reduced us to a trace of you,
Was there really nothing more to do?
